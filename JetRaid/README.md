Completed goals:
- Created and animated a jet fighter. The screen scrolls vertically, and the jet can move side to side. The player can accelerate or brake, which will change the vertical scrolling speed.
- Added a river bank on both sides of the level. Hitting the river bank will damage the player. Other obstacles spawn in the middle to make player move
- Bridge spawns. The player must shoot the bridge, colliding with it will kill the player.
- Enemy boats, helicopters, jets - move accross the screen shooting at player.
- Fuel depots - shooting them destroys all the enemies, colliding with it replenishes fuel
- UI with score/hp/fuel counters
- Ability to shoot and destroy enemy targets

Completed stretch goals:
- Game is infinitely scrolling.
- Particle effects

Other:
- Obstacles/Score/Background are affected by the length of play. The longer the game goes on,- the faster things move.
- Player immunity to damage if hit for a short time
